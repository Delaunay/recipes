* 1 ¾ sticks 
* 8 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate (60-70% cacao), roughly chopped

* 1 tablespoon espresso powder
* 2 cups granulated sugar
* ¼ sugar 
* ½ cup dark brown sugar, packed

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350°F (180°C). 
   Grease a 9x13-inch dark metal pan with softened butter, 
   then line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides. 
   Grease the parchment with softened butter.
#. Combine the chopped chocolate, ¼ cup of cocoa powder, 
   and espresso powder in a heatproof liquid measuring cup or medium bowl and set aside.
#. Add the butter to a small saucepan over medium heat and cook until
   the butter just comes to a vigorous simmer, about 5 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally.
   Immediately pour the hot butter over the chocolate mixture and let sit for 2 minutes. 
   Whisk until the chocolate is completely smooth and melted, then set aside.
#. Combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract, salt, and eggs in a large bowl. 
   Beat with an electric hand mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 10 minutes. 
   It will be similar to the texture of very thick pancake batter.
#. With the mixer on, pour in the slightly cooled chocolate and butter 
   mixture and blend until smooth.
#. Sift in the flour and remaining ½ cup of cocoa powder and use a rubber spatula
   to gently fold until just combined.
#. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top with a spatula. 
   Bake until lightly puffed on top, about 20 minutes.
